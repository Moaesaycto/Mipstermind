## **Features:**

* Code generation and validation; coloured-peg logic via integers.
* Guess parsing, exact/partial match scoring, limited attempts.
* Clear text UI for prompts, results, and end states.

## **Purpose:**
Practice low-level control flow, memory, and syscall I/O while recreating a classic logic game.
